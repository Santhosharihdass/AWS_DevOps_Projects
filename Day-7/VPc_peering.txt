AWS VPC Peering Between Mumbai and Virginia Regions
This project demonstrates the configuration of VPC Peering between two AWS regions: Mumbai (ap-south-1) and Virginia (us-east-1). VPC Peering allows private connectivity between VPCs across regions, enabling secure and scalable multi-region network architectures.

Project Overview:
VPC Creation:

Created two VPCs in different AWS regions (Mumbai and Virginia) with distinct CIDR blocks to ensure no overlap in IP address space.
Subnet & Route Table Configuration:

Defined public and private subnets within each VPC.
Associated each subnet with appropriate route tables for network traffic segmentation.
Internet Gateway Setup:

Attached Internet Gateways to both VPCs to enable internet access for instances in the public subnets.
VPC Peering:

Established a VPC Peering connection by sending a request from the Mumbai VPC and accepting it in the Virginia VPC.
This allowed direct communication over private IPs between instances in both regions.
Route Table Updates:

Updated route tables in both VPCs to allow traffic to flow between the peered VPCs by adding routes pointing to the peer's CIDR blocks.
Security Group Configuration:

Configured security groups to allow inbound and outbound traffic between instances across the VPC Peering connection.
Connection Testing:

Launched EC2 instances in both VPCs and tested private IP communication between them to verify the successful peering setup.
Key Features:
Multi-Region Networking: Enables cross-region communication using VPC Peering.
Private Network Architecture: Maintains secure traffic flow over private IPs without the need for VPNs or public Internet access.
Scalability: Demonstrates how to scale and expand your AWS infrastructure by connecting VPCs across regions.
AWS Services Used:
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
Internet Gateway
Route Tables
Security Groups
Future Improvements:
Implement multi-region failover and redundancy using services like Route 53.
Integrate more advanced security controls such as Network ACLs.

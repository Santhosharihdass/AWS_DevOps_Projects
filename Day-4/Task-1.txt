🚀 Day-4: Launched a Linux OS EC2 Instance with Volume Management & Explored Amazon EBS! 🖥️💻

Today was a productive day working with AWS cloud infrastructure, focusing on EC2 and EBS storage management. Here's a breakdown of what I achieved:

Task 1: Linux OS EC2 Instance with Volume Management
1️⃣ Launched a Linux OS EC2 instance on AWS and created a new EBS volume.
2️⃣ Attached the volume to the instance, verifying its visibility using df -h and lsblk.
3️⃣ Formatted the volume using the mkfs command.
4️⃣ Mounted the volume by creating a directory with mkdir and attaching it via mount.
5️⃣ Optimized the storage by resizing the volume with resize2fs.

It was a great hands-on learning experience with AWS EC2 and essential Linux commands like df -h, lsblk, mkfs, mkdir, mount, and resize2fs.

Task 2: Exploring Amazon EBS: Your Go-To Block Storage for EC2 Instances 🌐
🔹 Persistent & Reliable: EBS retains data even when EC2 instances are stopped or terminated, ensuring durability.
🔹 Flexible Storage Options: From General Purpose SSDs to Provisioned IOPS SSDs, EBS meets diverse storage needs.
🔹 Effortless Scaling: Resize volumes without downtime.
🔹 Snapshots for Backup: Secure your data with snapshots for disaster recovery.
🔹 Security Built-In: EBS volumes are encrypted at rest with AWS KMS, safeguarding data.

Amazon EBS is a game-changer for building secure, scalable, and resilient cloud solutions in AWS.

ðŸš€ Launched a Web Hosting Instance on AWS! ðŸš€

In this project, I created a custom Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and deployed an EC2 instance to host a clientâ€™s website. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of how I achieved this:

Project Overview
I set up a web hosting environment using AWS services to deliver a reliable and scalable website for my client.

Key Steps to Achieve the Deployment:
Creating a Custom AMI:

I started by launching an EC2 instance and configured the necessary software stack, including Apache or Nginx for web hosting.
After installing and configuring all required applications, I created a custom Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the instance. This allowed me to easily replicate the environment in the future, ensuring consistency across deployments.
Environment Configuration:

Configured the server environment to meet the specific needs of the clientâ€™s website, including setting up virtual hosts, enabling modules, and optimizing settings for performance.
Security Group Setup:

I configured security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic. This involved specifying allowed IP ranges and protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to ensure secure communication and minimize potential vulnerabilities.
Launching the EC2 Instance:

Using the created AMI, I launched a new EC2 instance, selecting instance types based on the expected traffic and performance requirements.
During this process, I configured storage options and ensured that the instance was set to auto-assign a public IP for accessibility.
Domain Configuration:

Although I didnâ€™t use Route 53, I connected the EC2 instance to a custom domain by updating the DNS records with the public IP address assigned to the instance. This step enabled users to access the website via a user-friendly URL.
SSL Configuration:

For secure communication, I installed an SSL certificate on the server. This involved generating a Certificate Signing Request (CSR), obtaining the certificate, and configuring the web server to use HTTPS.
Testing and Optimization:

After the deployment, I conducted thorough testing to ensure the website was functioning correctly. This included checking page load speeds, verifying SSL implementation, and ensuring all links were operational.
I optimized server settings for better performance, including caching mechanisms and resource allocation.
Outcome
This hands-on experience not only deepened my understanding of deploying scalable web applications on AWS but also equipped me with practical skills in configuring cloud infrastructure. I'm excited to share my journey and the code with the community! ðŸ’¡

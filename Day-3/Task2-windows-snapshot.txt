AWS EC2 Snapshot Management and Scaling
This project demonstrates how to launch, manage, scale, and back up a Windows EC2 instance on AWS using EBS volumes and snapshots.

Overview of Steps:
Launch EC2 Instance:
Deployed a Windows EC2 instance with specific network configurations, where the default IP was disabled and a static public IP was assigned to improve security and predictability.

Attach and Use Storage:
Attached an 8GB EBS volume to the instance and populated it with sample data to test data manipulation and storage capabilities.

Scale EBS Volume:
As the need for storage grew, scaled the EBS volume from 8GB to 10GB to meet new requirements, highlighting the flexible and scalable nature of AWS storage.

Create Snapshot for Backup:
Created a snapshot of the instance to ensure the current state is saved for future recovery or migration. This snapshot ensures data safety in case of system failure.

Terminate Instance:
After saving the snapshot, terminated the original EC2 instance to simulate an end-of-life scenario and to verify backup recovery steps.

Restore Snapshot:
Launched a new EC2 instance and successfully attached the snapshot as a volume, restoring all data and confirming the consistency and reliability of the backup.

Key Takeaways:
This scenario demonstrates how to manage cloud resources, scale storage dynamically, create backups via snapshots, and restore them to new instances.
It reinforces critical skills in AWS EC2 instance management, EBS storage operations, and disaster recovery.
Project Files:
This repository includes scripts to automate the instance creation, storage scaling, and snapshot creation processes.

Day 1:
ðŸš€ Excited to Share My Latest Project! ðŸš€
I've successfully hosted a website using an AWS EC2 instance! You can check it out here: http://13.201.226.66/. This project involved setting up and securing the server, configuring DNS, and optimizing the site for performance.
Also, here's my personal website showcasing some of my other work: https://lnkd.in/gcrTJhAX.
This experience helped me sharpen my skills in cloud infrastructure and web hosting. Looking forward to taking on more cloud projects!

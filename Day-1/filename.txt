ðŸš€ Website Hosting on AWS EC2: Day 1
In this project, I successfully hosted a website using an AWS EC2 instance. The project covers essential steps such as setting up the EC2 instance, installing a web server, and configuring security for optimal performance.

Key Steps
1. Connect to the EC2 Instance via SSH
To connect to the EC2 instance, use SSH with the private key (filename.pem) that you downloaded during the instance setup.

bash
Copy code
ssh -i filename.pem ec2-user@<ip-address>
2. Switch to Superuser
After connecting, elevate to superuser to have administrative control over the server.

bash
Copy code
sudo su
3. Update the System Packages
Always ensure the system is up-to-date by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
yum update -y
4. Install Apache (HTTPD) Web Server
Apache is a widely used web server, and installing it is a straightforward process on Amazon Linux using yum.

bash
Copy code
yum install httpd -y
5. Start the Apache Service
Once installed, start the Apache service to serve the website.

bash
Copy code
service httpd start
6. Test Website Access
After starting Apache, the website will be accessible through the EC2 instance's public IP address.

You can check out the website at: http://13.201.226.66/.

Outcome
Set up an AWS EC2 instance to host a website.
Installed and configured an Apache web server.
Gained hands-on experience with cloud infrastructure and web hosting on AWS.
Next Steps
Further optimize the website for performance.
Configure DNS for domain name mapping.
Implement security enhancements such as SSL/TLS encryption.

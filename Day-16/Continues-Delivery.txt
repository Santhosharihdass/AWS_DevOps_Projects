Day 16: AWS Continuous Delivery Pipeline - Step-by-Step Deployment Guide 🚀
This project expands on AWS CI/CD concepts, focusing on building a Continuous Delivery (CD) pipeline to automate application deployment with AWS services. Below is a breakdown of each step.

Steps:
Pipeline Setup and Initial Code Update 📜

Edited the index file to create an updated version.
Saved and pushed the modified file to Amazon S3 using AWS CLI commands, simulating an automatic integration step.
Verification of Updates 🌐

Confirmed the code update by checking the file on S3 and previewing the result in a browser, ensuring the pipeline accurately reflects changes.
Configuring SNS Notifications 📩

Subscribed to AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service) to receive real-time email alerts, providing quick insight into deployment statuses and events.
Why AWS Continuous Delivery? 🚀
Scalability: Handles growing demands as applications evolve.
Reliability: Ensures high availability and consistent deployments.
Real-Time Monitoring: SNS notifications make tracking and troubleshooting faster and more efficient.
Advantages of AWS CI/CD 🔑
Automation: Reduces manual tasks, increasing deployment speed and reliability.
Consistency: Uniform updates across environments minimize the chance of errors.
Cost-Efficiency: AWS’s pay-as-you-go model keeps costs low for high-quality performance.
By working hands-on with AWS CodePipeline, S3, CLI, and SNS, this project builds a foundation in automated deployment solutions, making it easier to handle complex CI/CD workflows. 🌟💪

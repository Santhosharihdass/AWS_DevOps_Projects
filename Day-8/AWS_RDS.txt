üöÄüåü Day 8: Mastering AWS RDS & EC2 - Database Management, Replication, and Scalability
Overview
I'm excited to share a hands-on project that helped me expand my skills in AWS RDS, EC2, and MySQL. Through this project, I delved into critical cloud concepts like database replication, high availability, and seamless integration between services‚Äîkey skills for any Cloud/DevOps Engineer. Below is a detailed breakdown of what I achieved:

üí° Key Highlights
Created an AWS RDS Subnet and launched a fully managed MySQL database within a VPC.
Set up an EC2 Ubuntu Instance and installed MySQL for data management directly from the instance.
Connected the EC2 instance to the RDS MySQL database and inserted sample data.
Implemented an RDS Read Replica for redundancy, ensuring high availability and data integrity.
Replaced the original database with the read replica, ensuring seamless integration with the EC2 instance.
Verified data integrity across the new database endpoint, confirming a smooth transition with no data loss.
ü§î Why AWS RDS?
Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) simplifies many complex tasks associated with managing databases, so you can focus on application development. Here's how RDS helps:

Automated Backups & Patching: Say goodbye to manual maintenance, RDS handles it for you.
Multi-AZ Deployments: Enhance availability by distributing databases across multiple availability zones.
Read Replicas: Improve read performance and redundancy by creating up to 5 read replicas.
Security: Integrated with AWS IAM for access control, and supports encryption at rest and in transit.
üßê Key Benefits of AWS RDS:
Automated Maintenance: No need for manual patching or updates‚ÄîRDS automates the process.
Scalability: Instantly scale your databases to meet growing demands.
Security: Secure your databases with encryption and fine-tuned access control using AWS IAM.
Cost-Efficiency: Pay only for what you use, with flexible options for scaling.
High Availability: With Multi-AZ deployments and read replicas, RDS offers robust resilience to downtime.
Types of Databases in AWS:
Amazon RDS: Fully managed relational database supporting MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server, and Amazon Aurora.
Amazon DynamoDB: A fully managed, serverless NoSQL database that can scale to handle any amount of data.
Amazon Redshift: A fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse for fast and cost-effective querying.

AWS VPC Project - 2-Tier Network Architecture
Project Overview
This project involves the design and deployment of a 2-tier network architecture using AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). The architecture is focused on providing secure communication between internet-facing resources and internal backend services, while ensuring network isolation and scalability.

Key Components:
VPC: Created a custom VPC with a 10.0.0.0/16 CIDR block.
Subnets:
Public Subnet (Tier 1): For hosting internet-facing resources with direct access to the internet.
Private Subnet (Tier 2): For internal backend services, isolated from external access.
Internet Gateway: Attached to the VPC to provide internet access to resources in the public subnet.
Route Tables:
Public Route Table: Connected to the Internet Gateway for internet-bound traffic in the public subnet.
Private Route Table: Linked to a NAT Gateway for secure outbound traffic from the private subnet.
NAT Gateway: Deployed in the public subnet to enable outbound internet access for resources in the private subnet without exposing them to external traffic.
Security Groups:
Public Security Group: Allows inbound SSH (22), RDP (3389), HTTP (80), and HTTPS (443) traffic for the frontend instances.
Private Security Group: Secures internal backend services with restricted access.
EC2 Instances:
Instance 1 (Public Subnet): Windows instance with a public IP for external RDP access.
Instance 2 (Private Subnet): Windows instance without a public IP, only accessible internally with outbound traffic via the NAT Gateway.
Validation:
Instance 1: Verified internet access and remote desktop connectivity (RDP) through the public IP.
Instance 2: Confirmed secure outbound access through the NAT Gateway, with no direct external exposure.
Technologies Used:
AWS VPC
Subnets (Public and Private)
Internet Gateway
NAT Gateway
Route Tables
Security Groups
AWS EC2 Instances (Windows)
Instructions:
To replicate this project, follow these steps:

Create a VPC with a 10.0.0.0/16 CIDR block.
Set up public and private subnets within the VPC.
Attach an Internet Gateway and configure the public route table.
Deploy a NAT Gateway and link it to the private route table.
Launch two Windows EC2 instances: one with a public IP in the public subnet, and one without a public IP in the private subnet.
Configure the necessary security groups and validate connectivity.
Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the design and deployment of a secure and scalable 2-tier network architecture on AWS, utilizing core AWS services like VPC, subnets, route tables, NAT Gateway, and security groups.

AWS CI/CD Pipeline Deployment 🌐🚀
In this project, I built a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using AWS services to automate the application deployment process. The objective was to enhance deployment efficiency, minimize manual intervention, and create a scalable infrastructure.

Key Highlights:
Purpose 🎯
To streamline application deployment and improve update efficiency through automation and reliable processes.

IAM Role Creation 🔑
Set up IAM roles for EC2 and CodeDeploy, ensuring secure access management.
Created an IAM user with developer permissions to manage AWS resources effectively.
Instance Deployment 💻
Launched two Amazon Linux EC2 instances and installed the CodeDeploy agent for automated deployments.
Scripting 📜
Developed bash scripts for environment setup and created three script files with appropriate permissions.
Configured the AWS CLI for seamless communication with AWS services.
AWS CodeDeploy Configuration 📦
Established a sample application in AWS CodeDeploy and created a deployment group for efficient management and tracking.
S3 Bucket Management ☁️
Created an S3 bucket to store application code and pushed the code using CLI commands for easy access.
Deployment Execution 🚦
Initiated the deployment through CodeDeploy, monitored the status in real-time, and verified success by accessing the web server via its IP address.
Advantages of the Project:
Automation 🤖 for faster deployments.
Scalability 📈 to meet growing demands.
Version Control 📊 for effective management.
Cost Efficiency 💰 by leveraging AWS services.
This project sharpened my technical skills in AWS and DevOps, providing practical experience in building robust CI/CD pipelines applicable to real-world scenarios. 🌟💪

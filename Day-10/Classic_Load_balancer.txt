üöÄ AWS Project: Classic Load Balancer & Auto Scaling Implementation üåê
Project Overview
This project focuses on deploying and managing a highly available infrastructure using AWS Classic Load Balancer and Auto Scaling. The goal was to ensure that the application remains fault-tolerant and scales automatically with traffic.

Key Steps Involved:
1. Launched Two EC2 Instances:
Created two EC2 instances.
Installed the Apache web server using shell commands to handle incoming web traffic.
2. Created a Classic Load Balancer:
Configured a Classic Load Balancer (CLB) to evenly distribute traffic across both EC2 instances.
This ensures availability and fault tolerance by routing traffic only to healthy instances.
3. Auto Scaling Setup:
Created an AMI from the configured instances to use for scaling.
Set up an Auto Scaling Group and defined scaling policies to handle traffic surges.
Monitored as Auto Scaling automatically launched two additional instances to balance traffic loads.
4. Auto Scaling Testing:
Simulated failure by manually terminating two instances.
Auto Scaling immediately responded by launching two new instances to replace the terminated ones, ensuring continuous service availability.
Why Use Load Balancers?
Load balancers are critical for distributing incoming traffic across multiple servers, preventing any single instance from being overwhelmed. This helps maintain high availability, scalability, and reliability for your application.

Types of AWS Load Balancers:
Classic Load Balancer (CLB): Basic load balancing across EC2 instances, supports HTTP/HTTPS and TCP.
Application Load Balancer (ALB): Works at the application layer (Layer 7), allowing for advanced routing based on URL paths, headers, etc.
Network Load Balancer (NLB): Optimized for performance at the network layer (Layer 4), ideal for low-latency, high-throughput scenarios.
Use Cases for Load Balancers:
Web Applications: Ensure seamless traffic distribution and high availability.
Microservices: Route requests based on specific rules or conditions.
Distributed Systems: Maintain service reliability by balancing workloads across different components of the system.
